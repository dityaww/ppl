              What is Batik?
            </h1>
            <p>
              Batik is a very valuable national cultural heritage of Indonesia.
              The history of batik in Indonesia can be traced to the period of
              the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms in the 7th to 14th centuries, and has
              continued to develop until now. After Indonesian independence in
              1945, batik was recognized as an important part of Indonesia
              national cultural heritage and became increasingly popular
              worldwide.
